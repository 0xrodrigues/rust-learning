# rust-learning

Personal repository to document my journey learning Rust from scratch.

This repo includes:
- Practical exercises and notes based on *The Rust Book*
- CLI experiments and basic projects
- Memory management, ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes deep dives
- Hands-on examples with collections, pattern matching, error handling, and async

My goal is to build a strong foundation in Rust and gradually evolve into advanced topics like Web APIs, systems programming, and blockchain development using Rust.

> "Learning Rust not just to code â€” but to engineer."

Feel free to explore, clone, and follow the evolution.

ðŸš€ Let's build something real.
